                        I am a Frontend Developer with a passion for creating intuitive and visually engaging web experiences.

This decision led me to my current role at Meta, where I have been working as a contractor, developing Ecommerce websites and managing complex global projects. My role involves developing modules, maintaining high-quality UI/UX across 16 different locales, and ensuring accurate localization, particularly for the Japanese market.
