                        After graduating from a university in Japan, I moved to the United States on my own. Leveraging my bilingual and bicultural skills, I have primarily worked in the field of international business between Japan and the U.S.

                        I have a strong interest in education, and for about seven years, I have been supporting opportunities for American elementary students to gain experience in Japan, as well as consulting Japanese university students on studying in the U.S. and building careers afterward.

                        During the Covid pandemic, I decided to change careers and pursued coding skills while working full-time. I later joined an NFT startup as a Project Manager, where I managed a VR artist community and created the companyâ€™s landing page.

                        Subsequently, as a Frontend Developer at Meta, I managed the eCommerce website across 16 languages. As the only bilingual developer on the team, I led the implementation of a Japanese line break tool. When I joined, the accuracy rate was about 20%, but by the time I left, it had improved to around 96%.

                        As a mother, I remain highly interested in the education sector. Every Saturday, I teach at a Japanese supplementary school, providing bilingual education to children using Japanese textbooks.

                        In my free time, I enjoy physical activities, especially martial arts, which I have practiced for many years. I also love exploring wineries on weekends, finding my favorite wines.
